  -- Different kind of fold --

  In the previous exercise we created a function called `bar`. This function
  took a list, an initial value and a two argument function and "folded" the
  list to a single value.

  In most libraries this function is called fold due to how it changes the
  structure of the List. It literally folds all the elements into a single
  value.

  A list can be folded in two different ways. From the left and from the right
  side.

  The implementation which we created is foldLeft.

    /*
      Part 1:

      Let's imagine a simple list: [1, 2, 3].

      We want to fold it from the left side. The initial value will be 0 and
      the operation is plus.

      foldLeft [1, 2, 3] 0 (+)

      Folding from the left would mean that the order of operations looks like:

      direction -->
      (((0 op 1) op 2) op 3)

      This is why this is easily expressed by a loop or a tail recursive call.
