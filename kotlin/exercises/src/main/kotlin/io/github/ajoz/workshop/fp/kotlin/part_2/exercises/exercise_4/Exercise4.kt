  -- Power of fold --

  It is not immediately obvious but fold as a concept is very powerful. It is
  possible to express many different List functions in terms of fold.

  Please implement all the parts of this exercise with the usage of foldLeft
  or foldRight (your choice).
 */

/*
  Part 1:

  Create a function that finds a maximal Integer from the list.
  If the list is empty an Exception should be thrown.

  Hints:
  - What should be the initial value?
  - You can use Math.max function to solve this

  - do not use List.size() method :-)
  - do we need the element for anything?

  Part 5:

  Create a function called `reverse` that returns the given list in the

  list of Integers.

  - what should be returned if the list is empty?
  - is fold the only operation we need to do?
  - you can use Lists.sum if you do not want to write fold on your own
    but for exercise sake please try to restrain yourself to only using

  - what should be the initial value for fold?
  - what should be returned if the List is empty?
  - assume that the all the List elements have the `equals` method
    correctly implemented

  Create a function called `join` that returns a String representation
  of the given list, it should be possible to specify the separator
  used by the `join`.

  - if List is empty then an empty string should be returned
  - what should be returned if there is only one element in the list

    between the list elements. Can we use Lists.tail and Lists.head for

  Part 9:

  Create a function called `penultimate` that returns the item next to the
  last item on the list.

  If the list is empty an Exception should be thrown.
  If the list has only one element and Exception should be thrown.

  Hint:
  - to make things easier elements of the list should be processed in pairs
  - what should be the starting pair?
  - think about using Lists.head and Lists.tail
