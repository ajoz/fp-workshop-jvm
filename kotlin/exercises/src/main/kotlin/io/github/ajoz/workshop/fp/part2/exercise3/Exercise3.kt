/*
  -- Different kind of fold --

  In the previous exercise we created a function called `bar`. This function
  took a list, an initial value and a two argument function and "folded" the
  list to a single value.

  In most libraries this function is called fold due to how it changes the
  structure of the List. It literally folds all the elements into a single
  value.

  A list can be folded in two different ways. From the left and from the right
  side.

  The implementation which we created is foldLeft.
 */

/*
  Part 1:

  Let's imagine a simple list: [1, 2, 3].

  We want to fold it from the left side. The initial value will be 0 and
  the operation is plus.

  foldLeft [1, 2, 3] 0 (+)

  Folding from the left would mean that the order of operations looks like:

  direction -->
  (((0 op 1) op 2) op 3)

  This is why this is easily expressed by a loop or a tail recursive call.
 */
fun <A, B> foldLeft(list: List<A>,
                    initial: B,
                    operator: (B, A) -> B): B {
    var accumulator = initial
    for (element in list) {
        accumulator = operator(accumulator, element)
    }

    return accumulator
}


/*
  Part 2:

  Now let's think how we can fold the same list: [1, 2, 3] from the right
  side. The order of operations would be:

  direction <--
  (1 op (2 op (3 op 0)))

  Implement foldRight

fun <A, B> foldRight(list: List<A>,
                     initial: B,
                     operator: (A, B) -> B): B {
    throw UnsupportedOperationException("Exercise 3 foldRight is missing!")
}

/*
  Part 3:

  Can we express foldRight in terms of foldLeft?

  Hint:
  - You can use methods from Lists class

fun <A, B> foldRight2(list: List<A>,
                      initial: B,
