  -- Looking at the flow of things --

  We already prepared many useful methods for working with the Flow class. We
  still are missing a few for:
  - peeking (or in other words looking) at the elements of the Flow without
    changing them
  - filtering of the Flow elements
  - keeping only distinct elements in the Flow
  - performing a flatMap operation on the Flow elements

  We will try to add those operations to the Flow interface that we already
  defined.

      Part 1:

      Implement the `flatMap` function. It should take a function that returns
      a Flow as an argument.

      Hints:
      - for each element of the upstream Flow<A> another Flow<B> is returned
      - doing simple map operation would mean returning Flow<Flow<B>>
      - Let's imagine a simple flow ["1", "2", "3"] and a function f that for
        the passed argument returns a 3 element flow containing the argument
        repeated. So for argument "1" function f would return ["1", "1", "1"]
        Doing flatMap operation on the ["1", "2", "3"] with the function f would
        mean that we would get a flow ["1", "1", "1", "2", "2", "2", "3", "3", "3"]

      Part 2:

        checked

        returned
